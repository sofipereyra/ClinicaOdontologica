# Dental Clinic
Project developed for the Backend subject in the Tech Developer program at Digital House.

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to develop a dental clinic with an API-based architecture and a frontend that consumes this API. The system will allow various operations related to the management of patients, dentists, and appointments.

The project is divided into two main parts: the development of the API and the implementation of the frontend.

Regarding the API, technologies such as Java, Maven, and SpringBoot will be used to create a robust and scalable backend. The API will provide endpoints to perform the following operations:

- Creation: It will allow the creation of new records for patients, dentists, and appointments. The required data will be received as parameters in the API requests and will be stored in a database.
- Listing: Lists of registered patients, dentists, and appointments can be obtained. This data will be returned in JSON format for easy consumption.
- Search by ID: It will be possible to search for a specific record using its unique identifier (ID). This will allow obtaining detailed information about a particular patient, dentist, or appointment.
- Editing: Existing patient, dentist, or appointment data can be updated. Changes will be made through API requests, providing the new values for the modified fields.
- Deletion: Patients, dentists, or appointments can be deleted from the clinic. This operation will be performed by making a request to the API, indicating the ID of the record to be deleted.

For the frontend development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used. An intuitive and user-friendly interface will be implemented to interact with the API easily. Users will be able to perform the aforementioned operations through forms and interactive elements.

## In summary 
This project aims to create a dental clinic with an API-based architecture and frontend. The API will provide endpoints for the creation, listing, search by ID, editing, and deletion of patients, dentists, and appointments. The frontend will enable users to interact with the API efficiently and user-friendly manner.
